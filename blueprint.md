n# Project Overview

Krishi Bazaar is a Flutter application that allows farmers to rent agricultural equipment. The app connects equipment owners with farmers who need to rent equipment for their farming activities. The app provides a platform for browsing, booking, and managing equipment rentals.

# Features Implemented

*   **Farmer Dashboard:** A dashboard that displays the different categories of equipment available for rent.
*   **Category Listing:** A screen that lists all the equipment available in a specific category.
*   **Equipment Detail:** A screen that shows the details of a specific piece of equipment, including its price, availability, and location.
*   **Booking:** A screen that allows farmers to book a piece of equipment for a specific period.
*   **Profile:** A screen that displays the user's profile information and provides access to their booking history.
*   **Booking History:** A screen that shows a list of all the equipment that the user has booked.
*   **Centralized Routing:** A centralized routing system that handles all the navigation in the app.
*   **Not Found Screen:** A screen that is displayed when a user tries to navigate to a route that does not exist.
*   **Theme Provider:** A theme provider that manages the application's theme.
*   **Light and Dark Themes:** The application now supports both light and dark themes.
*   **Theme Toggle:** A feature that allows users to switch between light and dark modes, and also to set the theme to follow the system settings.
*   **Modern UI:** The application has been updated with a more modern and visually appealing design, including a bottom navigation bar, horizontally scrolling category cards, and improved styling for the equipment listing and detail screens.
*   **Date and Time Pickers:** The booking screen now includes date and time pickers to allow users to select the start and end dates and times for their bookings.
*   **Login Screen with Social Media Buttons:** The login screen has been updated to include Google and Facebook login buttons, which are now displayed in a row for a cleaner and more user-friendly interface.

# Plan for Current Changes

*   **Arrange social media login buttons:** The social media login buttons on the login screen were arranged in a column. I have rearranged them to be in a row to improve the user interface.
*   **Add social media logos:** I have added the Google and Facebook logos to the `assets/images` directory and declared them in the `pubspec.yaml` file so they can be used in the application.
