# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a travel app that helps users plan and book their trips. The app allows users to search for flights, hotels, and rental cars. Users can also create a travel itinerary and share it with their friends and family.

## Style and Design

The app uses a modern and clean design. The color palette is based on a deep purple, with a white background. The typography is based on the Oswald and Roboto fonts. The app uses Material Design 3 components.

## Features

- User authentication (email/password and Google Sign-In)
- Flight search
- Hotel search
- Rental car search
- Travel itinerary
- User profile

## Current Task: Pet-Friendly Feature

I will be adding a new "Pet-Friendly" feature to the app. This feature will allow users to search for pet-friendly hotels and book a stay. The feature will include the following:

- A list of pet-friendly hotels
- A map view of the hotels
- The ability to book a stay
