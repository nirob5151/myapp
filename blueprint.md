# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the features and design of the equipment rental application.

## Implemented Features

*   **Light and Dark Themes:** The application now supports both light and dark themes.
*   **Theme Toggle:** A feature that allows users to switch between light and dark modes, and also to set the theme to follow the system settings.
*   **Modern UI:** The application has been updated with a more modern and visually appealing design, including a bottom navigation bar, horizontally scrolling category cards, and improved styling for the equipment listing and detail screens.
*   **Date and Time Pickers:** The booking screen now includes date and time pickers to allow users to select the start and end dates and times for their bookings.
*   **Login Screen with Social Media Buttons:** The login screen has been updated to include Google and Facebook login buttons, which are now displayed in a row for a cleaner and more user-friendly interface.

## Current Plan

*   **Implement Map View:** Create a new screen that displays a map with markers for each piece of equipment, allowing users to easily visualize the location of available items.
